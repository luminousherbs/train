<h1>Train Tracker - Powered By <span class="weak">TR</span>AI<span class="weak">N</span>.</h1>
  <p>âœ¨ Our revolutionary train tracking system uses GPT (Gap between the Platform and the Train) technology to deliver outstanding PhD-level hallucinations. Now you can see your train's arrival time with just 30 minutes of prompting. We've deleted our old tracking system for your convenience.</p>
